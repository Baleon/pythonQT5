Events:
GUI application are event-driven, events are generated mainly by the user of an application,
But they can be generated by other means as well
eg, an internet connection, a window manager, or a timer
when we call the application exec_() method, the application enters the main loop,the main loop fetches events and send
them to the objects

in the event model, they are three participants:
event source
event object
event target

the event source is the is the object whose state changes, it generates events, the event object(event) encapsulates the
state changes in the event source, the event target is the object that wants to be notified, event source object delegates
the task of handing an event to the event target.

Signals and slots are used for communication between objects, a signal is emitted when a particular event occurs, A slot can
be any python callable, a slot is called when its connected signal is emitted
